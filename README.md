This project is a simple web page visualisation that designed to allow a user in choosing a file from their computer and then produces histogram showing the number of 
occurrences on all alphabetical characters (ignoring case) within the input file. This program is done with support of RGraph library 
( http://www.rgraph.net/ ) for visualisation.

The page will first loaded with a button which will allow the user to select a file from a standard file selector dialog box. Once the user 
has chosen their file, javascript should count the number of occurrences (frequency) of each alphabetic character, regardless of whether 
that character is uppercase or lowercase. Ignoring any non-alphabetic characters (the site will be able to handle files containing 
non-alphabetic characters) the site will not handle complex file types containing unique formatting, it simply treat the file as a text 
file and process it one character at a time.
