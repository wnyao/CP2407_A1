## Description

Frequency visualization on alphabetical characters is intergrated with the function to frequency analysed alphabet characters within a document file or metadata file (if file is an image). You can select a text file from your computer and visualize the number of occurrence on all characters (ignoring cases) within the context. The graph below the web page will display the number of occurrence when it's loaded successfully. You can also sort the chart in descending order and clear the graph with the buttons below.
